# bamazon
an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL to hold the data and runs commands on Node js

# Customer Review:

This Node app runs to place an Order. It will display a list of the options available to sale. After showing the products it will ask you to select an option based on the ID of the product. Once the ID is selected you will be prompted to type the number of units you want to order.

After placing the order the app will display:
1. An alert that your order is being processed.
2. Your order: Chosen Item + units ordered.
3. The total cost of the order: price of chosen item x units ordered.

After placing the order, 1 of 2 things will happen:
1. Stock available for chosen item
2. Out of stock for chosen item

If stock is available the app wil promt you to choose another item. But if stock is not available it will prompt you to choose a different option.

*Disclaimer: the stock availability is updated in real time*
